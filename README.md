The flower dataset is not linearly separable, causing Logistic Regression to perform poorly with only 48% accuracy. On the other hand, a Neural Network with one hidden layer achieved 91% accuracy. The hidden layer, using the tanh activation function, captures the non-linear relationships, while the output layer uses sigmoid for binary classification. Additionally, as the number of units in the hidden layer increased, accuracy also improved. However, it is crucial to monitor for overfitting, which can occur with a high number of units.

Future Improvements: 

                   Further experiment with additional layers or units to balance model complexity and performance.

                   Implement regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, L2 regularization) to combat overfitting
